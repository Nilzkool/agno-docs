# Differential Equation Solver Toolkit

This toolkit provides a symbolic solver for first-order ordinary differential equations by leveraging the sympy library. It exposes a single method, `solve_ode`, which accepts an ODE formatted as a string (for example, "dy/dx = x + y"), the dependent variable, the independent variable, and an optional initial condition. When provided, the initial condition should be a JSON object such as {"x0": <number>, "y0": <number>}.

## How It Works

Internally, the toolkit uses sympy to parse and solve the ODE symbolically. If an initial condition is given, it computes a particular solution using the provided values. The response is returned as a JSON string containing either the solution or an error message if the solving process fails.

## Example

For instance, to solve the ODE "dy/dx = x + y" with an initial condition, you can call:

```python
solver = DifferentialEquationTools()
result = solver.solve_ode("dy/dx = x + y", initial_condition={"x0": 0, "y0": 1})
print(result)
```

This will return a JSON-formatted result with the solution.
