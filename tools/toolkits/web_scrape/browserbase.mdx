The Differential Equation Solver toolkit provides symbolic solutions for first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

Developed in the agno.tools library, the new DifferentialEquationTools class offers the solve_ode function. This function accepts an ODE expressed as a string in the format "dy/dx = expression" along with optional initial conditions provided as a dictionary (e.g. {"x0": 0, "y0": 1}).

On invocation, solve_ode parses the equation, applies sympy-based symbolic operations, and returns a JSON string detailing the solution or an error if encountered.

Example usage:

  • Import the toolkit:
    from agno.tools.diff_equations_solver import DifferentialEquationTools

  • Solve an ODE:
    solver = DifferentialEquationTools()
    result = solver.solve_ode("dy/dx = x + y", initial_condition={"x0": 0, "y0": 1})

This update aligns the documentation with the newly introduced differential equation solving capabilities.
